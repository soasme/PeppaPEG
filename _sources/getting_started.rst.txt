Getting Started
===============

Header File and Source File
--------------------------------

Peppa PEG has a header file and a C file, so you can add it to your project by copying files `peppa.h` and `peppa.c`.

Peppa PEG assumes your project is ANSI C (C89, or C90) compatible.

Once copied, add include macro and start using the library::

    #include "peppa.h"

Data Structures
---------------

All of the data structures and functions provided by Peppa PEG start with `P4_`
(Count the number of character "P" in **P** e **p** **p** a **P** E G).

Let's learn some basic P4 data structures:

* :c:struct:`P4_Grammar`: The grammar object that defines all grammar rules.
* :c:struct:`P4_Expression`: The grammar rule object.
* :c:struct:`P4_Source`: The content to parse.
* :c:struct:`P4_Node`. The node of an AST (abstract syntax tree), e.g. the final parsing result of a grammar given the source.

Step 1: Create Grammar
----------------------

In Peppa PEG, we always start with creating a :c:struct:`P4_Grammar`. We create such a data structure using :c:func:`P4_LoadGrammar`.

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :lines: 10-14

Step 2: Create Source
---------------------

We create a :c:struct:`P4_Source` using :c:func:`P4_CreateSource()`.

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :lines: 16-20

The first parameter is the content of the source.
The second parameter is the name of entry grammar rule.

In this example, we have only single rule `entry`, so the name can only be "entry".

Step 3: Parse
-------------

Now the stage is setup; call :c:func:`P4_Parse`. If everything is okay, it returns a zero value - :c:enum:`P4_Ok<P4_Error>`.

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :lines: 22-29

Step 4: Traverse AST
---------------------------

P4_Source contains a tree if parse successfully. We get the root node of such a tree using :c:func:`P4_GetSourceAst()`.

To traverse the AST,

* `node->head` is the first children.
* `node->tail` is the last children.
* `node->next` is the next sibling.
* `node->slice.start` is the start position in the source string that the slice covers.
* `node->slice.stop` is the end position in the source string that the slice covers.
* :c:func:`P4_CopyNodeString()` returns the string the AST node covers.

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :lines: 31-40

It may be helpful to output the source AST in JSON format:

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :lines: 44

Step 5: Clean Up
----------------

Last but not least, don't forget to free all the allocated memory.

* :c:func:`P4_DeleteSource()` deletes the source along with the entire tree.
* :c:func:`P4_DeleteGrammar()` deletes the grammar along with all the grammar rules.

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c
   :language: c
   :lines: 46-47

Full Example Code
-----------------

The complete code for this example:

.. literalinclude:: ../example.c

The output of the example looks like:

.. code-block::

    $ gcc -o example ../example.c ../peppa.c
    $ ./example
    root span: [0 11]
    root start: line=1 offset=1
    root stop: line=2 offset=6
    root next: (nil)
    root head: (nil)
    root tail: (nil)
    root text: Hello
    WORLD
    [{"slice":[0,11],"type":"entry"}]

Conclusion
----------

In this tutorial, we walk through the basic data structures and combine them in one example. The example parses nothing but "Hello World" to a single node.

I hope this example can get you a basic understanding of Peppa PEG. Now you can go back to :ref:`main` and pick more docs to read!
